# Choropleth Map

## freeCodeCamp Datavisualization Project

I'm trying to get as much as I can out of these D3 projects. I can tell they cover very useful and necessary skills, and there's so much to learn with each one! I'm still following the Ganesh videos, which have helped me not get stuck on all the new material. 

I learned/practiced
- GeoJSON and drawing a map using json and svg
- fetching json with d3.json(url).then
- topojson.feature
- drawing paths
- attr('d', d3.geoPath())
- use find method to return object and connect json data
- mouseover/mouseout event listeners for tooltip
